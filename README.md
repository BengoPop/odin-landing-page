# odin-landing-page
This is a project assigned by The Odin Project foundations setting. 
The purpose is to recreate a landing page they have provided.
The purpose of this exercise is to put together all that we learned
with flexbox, css, and html.
It does not have to be a perfect recreation nor does it need to be responsive currently.
